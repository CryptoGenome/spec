\caption{Tendermint consensus algorithm}
\label{alg:tendermint}
\end{algorithm}

In this section we present the Tendermint Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithm. 
The code of the algorithm is given as Algorithm~\ref{alg:tendermint}. We present the algorithm as a set of \emph{upon rules} that are executed atomically\footnote{In case several rules are active at the same time, the first rule to be executed is picked randomly. The correctness of the algorithm does not depend on the order in which rules are executed.}. We assume that processes exchange protocol messages using a gossip protocol and that both received and sent messages are stored in the local \emph{message log} for every process. An upon rule is triggered once the message log contains messages such that the corresponding condition evaluates to $\tt{true}$. The condition that assumes a reception of $X$ messages of a particular type and content, denotes a set of messages whose senders have aggregate voting power at least equal to $X$. The variables with index $p$ are process local state variables, while variables without index $p$ are value placeholders. The sign $*$ denotes any value.    

We denote with $n$ the total voting power of processes in the system, and we assume that the total voting power of faulty processes in the system is bounded with a system parameter $f$. 
The algorithm assumes that $n > 3f$, i.e., it requires that the total voting power of faulty processes is smaller than one third of the total voting power. For simplicity we present the algorithm for the case $n = 3f + 1$.

The algorithm proceeds in rounds, where each round has a dedicated \emph{proposer}. The mapping of rounds to proposers is known to all processes and is given as a function $\coord_p(h_p, round_p)$, returning the proposer for the round $round_p$ in the consensus instance $h_p$ at the process $p$. We assume that the proposer selection function is weighted round-robin, where processes are rotated proportional to its voting power\footnote{A validator with more voting power is selected more frequently, proportional to its power. More precisely, during a sequence of rounds of size $n$, every process is proposer in a number of rounds equal to its voting power.}. 

Processes exchange the following messages in Tendermint: $\Proposal$, $\Prevote$ and $\Precommit$. The 
$\Proposal$ message is used by the proposer of the current round to suggest a potential decision value, while 
$\Prevote$ and $\Precommit$ are votes for a proposed value. Tendermint belongs to the class 3 of consensus algorithms (like PBFT \cite{CL02:tcs} and DLS \cite{DLS88:jacm}) according to the classification of consensus algorithms from \cite{RMS10:dsn}, so it requires two voting steps (three communication exchanges in total) to decide a value. The Tendermint consensus algorithm is designed for the blockchain context where a value to decide is a block of transactions (so potentially quite big value). Therefore, in the Algorithm \ref{alg:tendermint} (similar as in \cite{CL02:tcs}) we are explicit about sending a value (block of transactions) and a small, constant size value id (a unique value identifier, normally a hash of the value, i.e., if $\id(v) = \id(v')$, then $v=v'$). The $\Proposal$ message is the only one carrying the value; $\Prevote$ and $\Precommit$ messages carry the value id. 
A correct process decides on a value $v$ in Tendermint upon receiving the $\Proposal$ for $v$ and $2f+1$ voting-power equivalent $\Precommit$ messages for $\id(v)$ in some round $r$. In order to send $\Precommit$ message for $v$ in a round $r$, a correct process waits to receive the $\Proposal$ and $2f+1$ the corresponding $\Prevote$ messages in the round $r$. Otherwise it sends $\Precommit$ message with a special $\nil$ value.  This ensures that correct processes can $\Precommit$ only a single value (or $\nil$) in a round. 
As a proposer might be a faulty process, the proposed value is treated by correct processes as a suggestion (it is not blindly accepted), and a correct process tells others if it accepted the $\Proposal$ for value $v$ by sending a $\Prevote$ message for $\id(v)$; otherwise it sends a $\Prevote$ message with a special $\nil$ value. 

Every process maintains the following variables in the Algorithm \ref{alg:tendermint}: $step$, $lockedValue$, $lockedRound$, $validValue$ and $validRound$. The $step$ denotes the current state of the internal Tendermint state machine, i.e., it reflects the stage of the algorithm execution in the current round. The $lockedValue$ stores the most recent value (with respect to a round number) for which a $\Precommit$ message has been sent. The $lockedRound$ is the last round in which the process sent $\Precommit$ message that is not $\nil$. We also say that a correct process locks a value $v$ in a round $r$ by setting $lockedValue = v$ and $lockedRound = r$ before sending $\Precommit$ message for $\id(v)$. As a correct process can decide a value $v$ only if $2f+1$ $\Precommit$ messages for $\id(v)$ are received, this implies that a possible decision value is a value that is locked by at least $f+1$ voting power equivalent of correct processes. Therefore, any value $v$ for which $\Proposal$ and $2f+1$ corresponding $\Prevote$ messages are received in some round $r$ is a \emph{possible decision} value. The role of the $validValue$ variable is to store the most recent possible decision value; $validRound$ is the last round in which $validValue$ is updated. Apart from those variables, a process also stores a current height ($h_p$) and a current round number ($round_p$) that are attached to every message. Finally a process also stores an array of decisions (Tendermint assumes a sequence of consensus instances) $decision_p$. 

Every round starts by a proposer suggesting a value with a $\Proposal$ message (see line \ref{line:tab:send-proposal}). In the initial round of each consensus instance (called \emph{height} in Tendermint), a proposer is free to chose the value to suggest. In the Algorithm~\ref{alg:tendermint}, a correct process obtains a value to propose using an external function    
$getValue()$ that returns a valid value to propose. In the following rounds, a correct proposer will suggest a new value only if $validValue \neq \nil$; otherwise $validValue$ is proposed (see lines~\ref{line:tab:isThereLockedValue}-\ref{line:tab:getValidValue}). Note that if a correct proposer $p$ sends $validValue$ with the $validRound$ in the $\Proposal$, this implies that the process $p$ received $\Proposal$ and the corresponding $2f+1$ $\Prevote$ messages for $validValue$ in the round $validRound$. In addition to the value proposed, the $\Proposal$ message also contains the $validRound$ so other processes are informed about the last round in which the proposer observed $validValue$ as a possible decision value.  
If a correct process sends a $\Proposal$ message with $validValue$ ($validRound > -1$) at time $t > GST$, by the \emph{Gossip communication} property the corresponding $\Proposal$ and the $\Prevote$ messages will be received by all correct processes before time $t+\Delta$. Therefore, all correct processes will be able to verify the correctness of the suggested value as it supported by the $\Proposal$ and the corresponding $2f+1$ voting power equivalent $\Prevote$ messages.   

A correct process $p$ accepts the proposal for a value $v$  (send $\Prevote$ for $id(v)$) if an external \emph{valid} function returns $true$ for the value $v$,
and if $p$ hasn't locked any value ($lockedRound = -1$) or $p$ has locked the value $v$ ($lockedValue = v$); see the line \ref{line:tab:accept-proposal-2}. 
In case the proposed pair is $(v,r)$ and a correct process $p$ has locked some other value ($v' \neq v$), it will accept $v$ only if $v'$ is a more recent possible decision value\footnote{As explained above, the possible decision value in a round $r$ is the one for which $\Proposal$ and the corresponding $2f+1$ $\Prevote$ messages are received for the round $r$.} in a round higher than $lockedRound_p$ ($r > lockedValue_p$).   
Otherwise, a correct process will reject the proposal by sending $\Prevote$ message with $\nil$ value. A correct process will send $\Prevote$ message with $\nil$ value also in case $\timeoutPropose$ expires (it is started when a correct process starts a new round) and a process has not sent $\Prevote$ message in the current round yet (see the line \ref{line:tab:onTimeoutPrevote}). 

If a correct process receives $\Proposal$ message for some value $v$ and $2f+1$ $\Prevote$
messages for $\id(v)$, then it sends $\Precommit$ message with $\id(v)$. Otherwise, it sends $\Precommit$ $\nil$. A correct process will send $\Precommit$ message with $\nil$ value also in case $\timeoutPrevote$ expires (it is started when a correct process sends a $\Prevote$ message and receives any $2f+1$ $\Prevote$ messages) and a process has not yet sent a $\Precommit$ message in the current round (see the line \ref{line:tab:onTimeoutPropose}). 
A correct process decides on some value $v$ if it receives in some round $r$ a $\Proposal$ message for $v$ and $2f+1$ $\Precommit$ messages with $\id(v)$ (see the line \ref{line:tab:decide}).  
To prevent the algorithm \ref{alg:tendermint} from blocking and waiting forever for this condition to be true, we rely on $\timeoutPrecommit$. It is triggered after a process receives any set of $2f+1$ $\Precommit$ messages for the current round. If the $\timeoutPrecommit$ expires and a process has not decided yet, the process starts the next round (see the line \ref{line:tab:onTimeoutPrecommit}).  
The timeouts are increased with every new round $r$, i.e, $timeoutX(r) = initTimeoutX + r*timeoutDelta$, and are reset for every new height (consensus instance). Increasing the timeout values ensures that eventually communication between correct processes in a round is reliable and timely such that correct processes can decide. 

\subsection{Termination mechanism}

Tendermint ensures termination by a novel mechanism that benefits from the nature of gossip communication (see \emph{Gossip communication} property).  
 It requires managing two additional variables, $validValue$ and $validRound$ that are then used by the proposer during the propose step as explained above.   
The $validValue$ and $validRound$ are updated to $v$ and $r$ by a correct process in a round $r$ when the process receives valid $\Proposal$ message for the value $v$ and the corresponding $2f+1$ $\Prevote$ messages for $id(v)$ in the round $r$ (see the rule at line~\ref{line:tab:recvPrevote}).

We now briefly give the intuition for how managing and proposing $validValue$ and $validRound$ ensures termination while leaving the formal treatment for later in Section~\ref{sec:proof}.  The first thing to note is that at the beginning of every round during the system execution there is at least a single correct process $c$ such that $validValue_c$ and $validRound_c$ are acceptable by every correct process. This is true as there exists a correct process $c$ such that for every other correct process $p$, $validRound_c > lockedRound_p$ or $validValue_c = lockedValue_p$. This is true as $c$ is the process that has locked the value in the most recent round among all correct processes (or no correct process locked any value). Therefore, if we assume that at the beginning of round $r_0$ in the good period (after GST and timeouts are big enough so communication between correct processes is timely and reliable) $c$ is that process and we assume that $c$ will be the proposer in a round $r_1 \ge r_0$ (as the proposer function is weighted round robin), and we assume that no correct process locks a value in rounds between, then the $validValue_c$ and $validRound_c$ will be acceptable by all correct processes. Note that we rely here on the \emph{Gossip communication} property that will ensure that $\Prevote$ messages that are received by $c$ at line~\ref{line:tab:recvPrevote} when $c$ updated $validValue_c$ in the round $validRound_c$ are received by all correct processes before $\timeoutPropose$ expires in the round $r_1$ (see the rule at line \ref{line:tab:acceptProposal}).   

The second thing to note is that during a good period, due to the \emph{Gossip communication} property, if a correct process $p$ locks a value $v$ in some round $r$, all correct processes will update $validValue$ to $v$ and $validRound$ to $r$ before the end of the round $r$ (we prove this formally in Section~\ref{sec:proof}). The intuition is that messages that led to $p$ locking a value $v$ in the round $r$ will be gossiped to all correct processes before the end of the round $r$, so it will update $validValue$ and $validRound$ (the lineline~\ref{line:tab:recvPrevote}). Therefore, if a correct process locks some value during the good period, $validValue$ and $validRound$ are updated by all correct processes so that the value proposed in the following rounds will be acceptable by all correct processes.

The last thing to note is that it is possible that during a good period, no correct process locks a value, but some correct process $q$ updates $validValue$ and $validRound$ during some round. As we assumed that no correct process locked any value, $validValue_q$ and $validRound_q$ will also be acceptable by all correct processes as $validRound_q > lockedRound_c$ for every correct process $c$ and as the \emph{Gossip communication} property ensures that the corresponding $\Prevote$ messages that $q$ received in the round $validRound_q$ are received by all correct process $\Delta$ time later. 

Therefore, the usage of the $validValue$ and $validRound$ variables and the \emph{Gossip communication} property together ensure that eventually, during a good period, there exists a round with a correct proposer whose proposed value will be accepted by all correct processes, and all correct processes will terminate in that round. Note that this mechanism does not require exchanging any additional information in addition to messages already sent as part of what is normally being called "normal" case -- contrary to the common termination mechanism illustrated in the Figure~\ref{ch3:fig:coordinator-change}.
