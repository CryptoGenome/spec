\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have proposed a new Byzantine-fault tolerant consensus algorithm that is at the core of the Tendermint BFT SMR platform. The algorithm
is designed for the wide area network with high number of mutually distrusted nodes that communicate over gossip based peer-to-peer network. It has only a single mode of execution and the communication pattern is very similar to the "normal" case of the state-of-the art PBFT algorithm. The algorithm ensures termination with a novel mechanism that takes advantage of the gossip based communication between nodes.
The proposed algorithm and the proofs are simple and elegant, and we believe that this makes it easier to understand and implement correctly.
